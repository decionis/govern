> **Before software executes, Decionis decides whether it's allowed to.**

GitHub Actions runs the code. **Decionis decides whether the run is authorized.** Add one step and every deploy, migration, infra change, or AI-generated PR is evaluated against your policy, approvals, and risk — then **allowed, blocked, or escalated** before it executes, with a signed Decision Dossier as audit-ready proof.

Start in **shadow mode** — it never fails your build, so you see exactly what Decionis would govern. Enforce with one line when you're ready.

## The question every pipeline now faces

AI coding agents — **Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Codex, OpenHands** — now open PRs, edit workflows, write migrations, and trigger deploys. The hard question is no longer _"who wrote this code?"_ It's:

> **Should this action be allowed to execute?**

That's the Action Gate.

## 30-second quickstart

**Wrap the command you want to govern.** Decionis runs it _through_ the gate, so it can't execute without an authorizing verdict:

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    run: ./deploy.sh # ← Decionis runs this ONLY if it authorizes the action
```

On `allow` the command runs. On `block`/`escalate` it **never runs** and the step fails. Try it risk-free with `mode: shadow` — the command still runs, but Decionis only records the verdict (never fails the build):

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    run: ./deploy.sh
    mode: shadow # observe-only; records the verdict, never blocks
    comment-pr: "true" # posts the verdict + verify link on the PR
```

Need keys? Create them free at **[decionis.com/quickstart?source=github_action](https://decionis.com/quickstart?source=github_action)** — no card, no call.

### Cryptographic proof, verified at the target

Set `request-grant: true` and every authorized run carries a short-lived, single-use, signed **Execution Grant** — `DECIONIS_EXECUTION_GRANT` in the command's environment. Your deploy target verifies it against Decionis's public keys before it acts, so authorization is proven where the action actually happens.

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    request-grant: true
    grant-audience: prod-us-east
    run: ./deploy.sh # presents $DECIONIS_EXECUTION_GRANT to the target
```

### Zero standing credentials

Take secrets out of CI entirely. Register a target's credential with Decionis once, and it's released only in exchange for an authorized run — your pipeline holds nothing to leak. See [`examples/gate-deploy-broker.yml`](./examples/gate-deploy-broker.yml), or federate **GCP Workload Identity Federation** / **Azure** so the cloud issues credentials only for a Decionis-authorized deploy.

## Three concepts

### 1. 🚦 Action Gate

One verdict before execution — **`allow`**, **`block`**, or **`escalate`**. Composable into any later step via `steps.<id>.outputs.decision`.

### 2. 🟣 Shadow Mode

`mode: shadow` shows exactly what Decionis would govern, without ever failing a build. Enforce when you're ready — one line.

### 3. 🧾 Decision Dossiers

Every verdict produces a signed, public-verifiable [Decision Dossier](https://decionis.com/dossier-example?source=github_action): **why** it happened, **who** approved it, **which policy** applied, and the **risk**. The verify link unfurls as an OG card in Slack / Teams / LinkedIn — paste it in an incident, a change ticket, or an audit and it holds up.

## Govern AI-generated changes

When an AI agent opens a PR or triggers a deploy, gate it **before** it merges or ships:

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  id: gate
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: ai_change_gate
    action: ai-generated-pr
    comment-pr: "true"
    payload: |
      { "author": "${{ github.actor }}", "agent_generated": true }
```

See [`examples/gate-ai-agent-pr.yml`](./examples/gate-ai-agent-pr.yml) for the full recipe (auto-detects agent authorship and requires a human verdict on risky changes).

## Also governs

- **Deployments** — production releases, blue/green cutovers
- **Infrastructure** — `terraform apply`, Pulumi, CDK
- **Data** — database migrations, destructive jobs
- **Privileged workflows** — release pipelines, secrets rotation, IAM changes

## What reviewers see on the PR

A single, **self-updating** comment — it stays current on every run:

| `execution-grant`  | Signed Execution Grant (EdDSA JWT) when `request-grant: true` and authorized. |
| `grant-expires-at` | ISO timestamp when the Execution Grant expires.                               |

## Permissions

Default (`contents: read`) is enough. To enable `comment-pr: 'true'`:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

## How it works

The action calls `POST /v1/protocol/evaluate-decision` with the action label + payload (or a payload built from the workflow context), and returns the signed verdict. Inputs are echoed into the dossier so you can audit exactly what produced it. `shadow` mode **never** fails the step; a non-200 from the API fails the step with the status — no silent green builds.
