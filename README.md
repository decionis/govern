# 🛡️ Decionis Action Gate

**Stop unauthorized deploys, migrations, and infra changes before they reach production — whether a teammate or an AI agent triggered them.**

Add **one step** to your workflow, and every deploy, migration, infra change, or AI-generated PR is checked against **your** policy — then **allowed, blocked, or escalated before it runs**, with a signed, verifiable record of every decision.

**Try it in 30 seconds, risk-free.** Start in shadow mode: it records what _would_ be governed without ever failing a build — so you see the value before you enforce anything.

---

## The question every pipeline now faces

AI coding agents — **Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Codex, OpenHands** — now open PRs, edit workflows, write migrations, and trigger deploys. The hard question is no longer _"who wrote this code?"_ It's:

> **Should this action be allowed to execute?**

That's the Action Gate.

## Why Decionis

- **One verdict per governed action** — `allow` / `block` / `restrain` / `escalate`, evaluated against _your_ policy before anything runs.
- **Deterministic policy you own** — versioned rules, committed as `DECIONIS_POLICY.md` or connected from where policy already lives; every verdict cites the version that applied.
- **Cryptographic proof** — each decision is a signed, public-verifiable Decision Dossier: audit-ready evidence of what was authorized and why.
- **Zero-friction adoption** — start in shadow mode in 30 seconds; it never fails a build until you choose to enforce.

## Set it up in one step

Pick whichever is fastest — both drop a **shadow-mode** gate in, so nothing fails your build on day one:

- **New repo:** [**Use this template →**](https://github.com/decionis/agent-safe-pipeline/generate) a ready-wired pipeline + `DECIONIS_POLICY.md`.
- **Existing repo, one command:**
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://decionis.com/govern/install.sh | sh
  ```
  Writes the workflow + `DECIONIS_POLICY.md` (no secrets touched). Add `--pr` to open the PR for you.

Then add your `DECIONIS_API_KEY` / `DECIONIS_ORG_ID` secrets — [free keys here](https://decionis.com/quickstart?source=github_action).

## 30-second quickstart

**Wrap the command you want to govern.** Decionis runs it _through_ the gate, so it can't execute without an authorizing verdict:

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    run: ./deploy.sh # ← Decionis runs this ONLY if it authorizes the action
```

On `allow` the command runs. On `block`/`escalate` it **never runs** and the step fails. Try it risk-free with `mode: shadow` — the command still runs, but Decionis only records the verdict (never fails the build):

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    run: ./deploy.sh
    mode: shadow # observe-only; records the verdict, never blocks
    comment-pr: "true" # posts the verdict + verify link on the PR
```

### Cryptographic proof, verified at the target

Set `request-grant: true` and every authorized run carries a short-lived, single-use, signed **Execution Grant** — `DECIONIS_EXECUTION_GRANT` in the command's environment. Your deploy target verifies it against Decionis's public keys before it acts, so authorization is proven where the action actually happens.

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    request-grant: true
    grant-audience: prod-us-east
    run: ./deploy.sh # presents $DECIONIS_EXECUTION_GRANT to the target
```

### Zero standing credentials

Take secrets out of CI entirely. Register a target's credential with Decionis once, and it's released only in exchange for an authorized run — your pipeline holds nothing to leak. See [`examples/gate-deploy-broker.yml`](./examples/gate-deploy-broker.yml), or federate **GCP Workload Identity Federation** / **Azure** so the cloud issues credentials only for a Decionis-authorized deploy.

## What you get

### 1. 🚦 A verdict before anything runs

One verdict before execution — **`allow`**, **`block`**, or **`escalate`**. Composable into any later step via `steps.<id>.outputs.decision`.

### 2. 🟣 A zero-risk way to start

`mode: shadow` shows exactly what would be governed, without ever failing a build. Enforce when you're ready — one line.

### 3. 🧾 Proof you can hand an auditor

Every verdict produces a signed, public-verifiable [Decision Dossier](https://decionis.com/dossier-example?source=github_action): **why** it happened, **who** approved it, **which policy** applied, and the **risk**. The verify link unfurls as an OG card in Slack / Teams / LinkedIn — paste it in an incident, a change ticket, or an audit and it holds up.

---

## Your policy — what the gate evaluates against

Every gated action is evaluated against **your organization's policy**: the rules that decide whether an action is **allowed, blocked, restrained, or escalated**. You own those rules.

- **Zero config to start.** Out of the box, Decionis applies a built-in **default policy pack** for your workflow's vertical (core, finance, hospitality, and more), so the 30-second quickstart governs immediately — no policy authoring required.
- **Make it yours, and it's versioned.** Add or update rules at any time; Decionis **versions every change**, and each verdict's Decision Dossier records exactly **which policy version applied** — so an audit can trace any decision back to the rule that made it.
- **Bring policy from where it already lives.** Build rules dynamically, **upload or paste** a policy file, or **connect the source of truth** and Decionis keeps the encoded policy in sync — **Google Drive, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Notion, or SAP.**

The result: the gate isn't a generic check — it enforces _your_ rules, kept current with how your organization actually documents them.

### Policy as a file: `DECIONIS_POLICY.md`

Keep policy where developers already work — in the repo, in Markdown, reviewed by PR. Drop a **`DECIONIS_POLICY.md`** at your repo root and the action reads it, **content-hashes it, and injects it into every decision** — so the gate governs against your repo's policy and the signed Decision Dossier records exactly which policy (by `sha256`) applied. Change the file, get a new recorded revision. No dashboard step.

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  with:
    workflow-key: github_deploy_approval
    action: production-deploy
    # policy-file: DECIONIS_POLICY.md   # default; set "" to disable
    run: ./deploy.sh
```

Outputs `policy-sha256` + `policy-path`. A missing/unreadable file never fails the gate. See the annotated [example policy](./examples/DECIONIS_POLICY.md) to copy — or the [DevOps/CI example](./examples/DECIONIS_POLICY.devops.md) (escalate infra destroys, restrain applies + release deploys, block during change freeze). For an **org-wide** policy, point a Git source connector at your `.github` repo's `DECIONIS_POLICY.md`.

## Govern AI-generated changes

When an AI agent opens a PR or triggers a deploy, gate it **before** it merges or ships:

```yaml
- uses: decionis/govern@v1
  id: gate
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_API_KEY }}
    org-id: ${{ secrets.DECIONIS_ORG_ID }}
    workflow-key: ai_change_gate
    action: ai-generated-pr
    comment-pr: "true"
    payload: |
      { "author": "${{ github.actor }}", "agent_generated": true }
```

See [`examples/gate-ai-agent-pr.yml`](./examples/gate-ai-agent-pr.yml) for the full recipe (auto-detects agent authorship and requires a human verdict on risky changes).

## Also governs

- **Deployments** — production releases, blue/green cutovers
- **Infrastructure** — `terraform apply`, Pulumi, CDK
- **Data** — database migrations, destructive jobs
- **Privileged workflows** — release pipelines, secrets rotation, IAM changes

## What reviewers see on the PR

A single, **self-updating** comment — it stays current on every run:

| `execution-grant`  | Signed Execution Grant (EdDSA JWT) when `request-grant: true` and authorized. |
| `grant-expires-at` | ISO timestamp when the Execution Grant expires.                               |

## Permissions

Default (`contents: read`) is enough. To enable `comment-pr: 'true'`:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

## How it works

The action calls `POST /v1/protocol/evaluate-decision` with the action label + payload (or a payload built from the workflow context), and returns the signed verdict. Inputs are echoed into the dossier so you can audit exactly what produced it. `shadow` mode **never** fails the step; a non-200 from the API fails the step with the status — no silent green builds.
